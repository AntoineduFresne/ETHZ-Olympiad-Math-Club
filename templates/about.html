                    We are a group of passionate mathematicians dedicated to solving challenging problems and exploring the beauty of mathematics. Our club focuses on preparing for and participating in mathematical competitions. In August 2025, seven of us took part of the International Mathematics Competition for University Students (IMC). In November 2025, we'll take part (for the first time!) in the <a href="https://icmathscomp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICMC</a>.

                    <p class="card-text">
                     Our mission is to foster a love for mathematics, encourage problem-solving skills, and provide a space for students to meet and challenge themselves with Olympiad-style problems. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced problem-solver, we hope you'll find something in our meetings to inspire you.
