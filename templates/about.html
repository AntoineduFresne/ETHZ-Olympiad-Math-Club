                        We are a group of passionate mathematicians dedicated to solving challenging problems and exploring the beauty of mathematics. Our club focuses on preparing for and participating in mathematical competitions, especially this year in the International Mathematics Competition for University Students (IMC). However, in the long term, we aim to improve and take part in other competitions. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Our mission is to foster a love for mathematics, encourage problem-solving skills, and provide a space for students to meet and challenge themselves with Olympiad-style problems. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced problem-solver, we hope you'll find something in our meetings to inspire you.
